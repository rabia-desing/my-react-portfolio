I'll also include a professional photo of myself to add a personal touch, and a brief summary of my experience and qualifications. Lastly, I'll include a call to action that encourages visitors to explore my portfolio or contact me directly.

The Contact page includes a contact form that visitors can use to reach out to me directly. In addition, I'll provide my email address and phone number for direct contact.
